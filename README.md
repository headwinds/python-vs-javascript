## Contributing

This single page app is created with [VueJS 3.0](https://vuejs.org/). Each lesson has its own vue file and should be easy to find via a client-side search (which is yet to be implemented). If you would like to edit or add a lesson, please fork the projec, find the lesson you want to edit or use the Template.vue file to create your own and then make a PR.
